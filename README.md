# Wannabe Fullstack project
It's a simple project where I'm playing with stuff. Right now the list of things I don't know, but I try to use here includes:
- Next.js
- Vercel
- Husky and commitlint

The stack was picked at random. Also, at this point, I'm not sure what the project will be. I'm kind of leaning towards the idea of a chat that will match two random people (just to include something nice with WebSockets, Firebase maybe?)

## Prerequisites
I'm not sure if I'll "dockerize" it so here's the env I'm using:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Node 14.17.5
- npm 6.14.14

I haven't tested other envs, so I can't say if it's going to work on yours.

## Installation 
Run following in root dir:
```bash
npm i  
```

## Running project locally
Run following in root dir:
```bash 
npm run dev
```

## Online demo
Thanks to Vercel, this project can be viewed live on [https://nextjs-roan-mu-92.vercel.app/](https://nextjs-roan-mu-92.vercel.app/)
